  <h1>Hello, my name is Cameron Spencer.</h1>
  <p>I&apos;m a designer, developer, maker, podcaster, and musician living in San Francisco.</p>
  <p>I operate <a href='http://www.lab43.com/'>Lab 43</a>, a one-man web design and development agency.</p>
  <p>I&apos;m an avid maker of things. Every Tuesday I post a video to my <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGTlxm5dDGGP0rgXW6YxPIw'>YouTube channel</a> about a project I&apos;m working on. Topics include woodworking, metalworking, 3d printing, and whatever else I&apos;m interested in at the moment.</p>
  <p>In 2013 I created <a href='https://www.usefulscience.org'>Useful Science</a> with <a href='https://jaan.io'>Jaan Altosaar</a>. In 2015 we added <a href='https://www.usefulscience.org/podcast'>a podcast</a>, which I host along with a rotating team of scientists.
  <p>I&apos;m also a music teacher and arranger. I&apos;ve taught and written for high school marching bands and percussion ensembles since 2003. In 2019 I founded <a href='https://www.spencer-sound.com'>Spencer Sound</a> to manufacture carts, racks, and props used by programs like these.</p>

  <h3>About the name and logo</h3>
  <p>I realized a long time ago that <em>Cameron Spencer</em> makes an awfully long username and isn&apos;t very Googleable, so I came up with the word <em>eusonic</em> as an alternative. It&apos;s meant to mean <em>good sounding,</em> from the prefix <em>eu</em> meaning <em>good</em> and the root <em>sonic</em> meaning <em>sound.</em> At the time I was studying music, so it made sense to associate my online identy with sound. I write <em>eusonic</em> with all lowercase letters because I think it looks better.</p>
  <p>The logo I use for <em>eusonic</em> is based on <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moses_Harris,_Prismatic_Colour_Wheel,_1766.jpg'>an illustration</a> from <em>The Natural System of Colours</em> by Moses Harris, published in 1766. Three colors equidistent from eachother on the color wheel form gray/black when combined subtractively (like paint) and white when combined additively (like light). This site simulates this by using the css property <code>mix-blend-mode</code>. By default this site uses <code>multiply</code> to simulate subtractive color mixing. Switch it to dark mode using the flashlight in the top right corner to see additive color mixing simulated with <code>screen</code>.</p>
