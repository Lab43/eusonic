## Building and Watching

This is the repo for my personal website www.eusonic.com. It's built with my open source static site generator [Underdot](https://github.com/Lab43/underdot).

* First run `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Use `npm run build` to compile the site.
* Use `npm run watch` to have [nodemon](https://nodemon.io) automatically compile the site when it detects changes in the source directory.
